Hi! My name is Renan and this is my personal blog. In this blog I will write everthing in english to force myself to improve my english skills. I love computer science and I have used PHP, Java, Angular, C, Javascript, Golang, MongoDb and Postgres for professional proposes. Iâ€™m a ZPCE (Zend PHP Certified Engineer) too and I love PHP a little bit more than anothers languages, but I think that the language is just a tool to solve problems in projects. Computer programming is what I make in my free time (and in my work time) and I love so much that have people with pay me for make that. :)
